# Appending to text file by using A as the mode, Opening a text file in append mode causes data to be written to 
# the end of the file without overwriting the exiting contents.
# t stands for text mode which is the default. 
# OTHER MODES:
# X - open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists
# B - Binary mode
# + - open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
# U - Univeral newlines mode (deprecated)
# For binary read-write access, the mode "w+b" opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes; "r+b" opens the file without truncation.

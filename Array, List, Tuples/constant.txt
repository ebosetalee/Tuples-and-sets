A constant is a fixed value that doesn't change.

Mathematics and Physical sciences use lots of constants.

For example:
- Pi: The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter = 3.141592653589793
- e: The base of natural logarithms = 2.718281828
- Avogadro's constant: The number of particles in one mole = 6.02214076E23
- c: The speed of light in a vacuum = very fast

Thus, constants musn't be changed.

In Python, Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.
Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
